** Discussions 2019 August
+ Discussions between Eduardo and Will during Eduardo's visit to Morelia
*** The back-scattered component
+ Gives red-shifted shoulder/wing to many lines
  + More prominent in higher ionization (e.g., [O III]) but also seen in [N II]
+ See the positive channels of these isovelocity maps:
  + [[file:figs/multi-panel-isovel-oiii-nii.pdf]]
  + Based on Doi:2004a and Garcia-Diaz:2008a
+ This mainly maps the distribution of dust in the neutral/molecular filaments
  + Same ones that are traced by fluorescent O I lines
+ Secondary influence of orientation effects
  + In the most red-shifted channels (Vhel > +50 km/s), face-on illuminated filaments predominate
  + Edge-on illuminated filaments are seen at intermediate red-shifted velocities (Vhel ~ +40 km/s).  Examples are:
    + Bright Bar
    + SW Compact Bar
*** Finding chart for nebular features 
This is from Garcia-Diaz:2007a
[[figs/finding-chart-orion.png]]
*** Other ideas for Eduardo to pursue
1. Diagnostics of density/temperature from the O II permitted lines
   - See Peimbert & Peimbert 2013ApJ...778...89P
   - Also, see Will's notes on analysis of this for nebula
     - [X] Add those notes to project. Done

** Shock emission in HH 204

*** [O III] versus H\alpha emission
#+attr_html: :width 300
[[./figs/HH204-shock-shell_1.png]]

+ [O III] is in red
+ H\alpha is in cyan
+ You can see a very thin [O III] layer at the leading edge of the shock
+ But why is the [O III] emission not limb-brightened?


** Results from Adal's previous UVES observations of HH202-S

*** Dust destruction
Fe, Ni, Cr abundance higher by factor of about 10 in shocked gas

*** ADFs
+ Gets high ADF for C^{2+} but
  + might be fluorescence if it is from the 723X lines
    + No, seems mainly based on 4267 which should be unaffected
  + Also it is based on 3rd party [C III] NUV observations
