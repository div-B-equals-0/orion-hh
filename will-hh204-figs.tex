\subsection{Sub-arcsecond imaging of HH 204}
\label{sec:high-resol-imag}

Figure~\ref{fig:ratio-hst-oiii-ha}a shows the ratio of surface brightnesses,
\(R(\oiii) = S(\oiii\ \wav{5007}) / S(\ha\ \wav{6563})\),
calculated from \textit{HST} WFPC2
observations in the F502N, F547M, F656N, and F658N filters
from program GO5469 \citep{ODell:1996a}.
Flux calibration and correction for contamination by continuum and non-target lines
was performed using the coefficients given in \citet{ODell:2009b}.
It can be seen that the line ratio in the background nebula shows a pronounced gradient
from \(R(\oiii) \approx 0.3\) in the north-east
to \(R(\oiii) \approx 0.5\) in the south-west.%
\footnote{
  For comparison with results from our UVES spectra,
  and using the average reddening for the HH~204 region \citep{Weilbacher:2015a},
  the conversion is \(\wav{4959} / \hb \approx 1.1 R(\oiii)\).
}
Inside the bow shock, the ratio is significantly smaller,
for instance falling from \(\simeq 0.4\) to \(\simeq 0.2\) along the length of the UVES slit.

However, the most interesting feature of the \(R(\oiii)\) image is the slight
\emph{increase} in the ratio that is seen
in a thin layer along the leading edge of the bow shock.
This is most clearly visible in the northern wing of HH~204,
such as the area highlighted by a dotted outline box in the figure.
Average profiles across the shock for this region
are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ratio-hst-oiii-ha}b.
The lower panel shows that the raw ratio (solid black line) increases only slightly
above its value in the background nebula,
which is because the brightness increase across the bow shock is
only a small fraction of the background brightness, as can be appreciated in the upper panel.
In order to isolate the behavior of the shocked component,
we calculate the background-subtracted line ratio:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:ratio-bg-sub}
  R'(\oiii) = \frac{S(\oiii) - S\BG(\oiii)}{S(\ha) - S\BG(\ha)}
\end{equation}
under the assumption that \(S\BG\) for each line is constant along the profile.
The result is shown as a gray histogram in the lower panel of the figure,
which reveals a sharp peak of width \(\approx \SI{0.3}{mpc}\)
that reaches a maximum value \(R'(\oiii) \approx 2 R\BG(\oiii)\)
and is centered on a displacement of \(\approx \SI{-0.1}{mpc}\).
The origin of the displacement axis is set to the peak
in the spatial gradient of the \ha{} surface brightness,
corresponding to the outer edge of the dense shocked shell.
The negative displacement of the \(R'(\oiii)\) peak means that this occurs
\emph{outside} the dense shell, closer to the shock front itself. 

Figure~\ref{fig:ratio-hst-oiii-ha}c shows the same quantities
calculated along a cut that coincides with our UVES slit at the head of HH~204.
In this case, \(R'(\oiii)\) is always significantly less than \(R\BG(\oiii)\),
but it does still show a small local peak with a position and width
that is similar to the more impressive one in the northern wing.
These peaks in \(R'(\oiii)\) occur over a much smaller scale than
any of spatial gradients that we find in our UVES slit spectra
and are only detectable because of the high spatial resolution of the \textit{HST}.%
